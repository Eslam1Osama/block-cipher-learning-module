# Block Cipher Operation Modes – Web Learning Module

This project is a detailed educational webpage designed to help students grasp the concepts of **Block Cipher Operation Modes**, a key topic in **Data Security** courses.

## 📚 Purpose

- Improve students’ understanding through visual and interactive learning
- Highlight security implications of each mode
- Provide quiz-style revision questions
- Replace static documents with modern web-based references

- ECB (Electronic Codebook)
- CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
- CFB (Cipher Feedback)
- OFB (Output Feedback)
- CTR (Counter Mode)
- Comparison of advantages and disadvantages
- Common real-world use cases
- Review questions and answers

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
