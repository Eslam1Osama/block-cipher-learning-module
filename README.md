## ‚ú® Features

This module is packed with features designed to enhance the learning process:

-   **Segmented Content:** The course material is broken down into logical sections for each cipher mode (ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR) plus an introduction and a quiz.
-   **Interactive Navigation:** Users can switch between sections using a sticky navigation bar on desktop or a dropdown menu on mobile devices.
-   **Visual Aids:** Each mode is explained with clear diagrams, advantages, disadvantages, and technical formulas.
-   **Progress Tracking:** A visual progress bar at the top shows students how far they've progressed through the module.
-   **Review Quiz:** A dedicated section with questions and expandable answers to test student comprehension.
-   **High-Quality Downloads:**
    -   Download any individual section as a high-resolution JPEG image.
    -   Download all sections at once as a convenient ZIP file.
-   **Light & Dark Mode:** A persistent theme toggle for comfortable viewing.
-   **Fully Responsive:** Optimized for a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## üìö Topics Covered

This module provides a comprehensive overview of the five primary block cipher modes of operation:

1.  **Introduction:** Core concepts like Block Ciphers and Initialization Vectors (IVs).
2.  **Electronic Codebook (ECB):** The simplest mode, highlighting its strengths and significant security weaknesses.
3.  **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC):** A widely used mode that introduces dependency between blocks.
4.  **Cipher Feedback (CFB):** Operation as a self-synchronizing stream cipher.
5.  **Output Feedback (OFB):** Operation as a synchronous stream cipher.
6.  **Counter (CTR):** A modern, high-performance mode that allows for parallel processing.
7.  **Review Quiz:** Questions comparing the security and error handling of the different modes.
